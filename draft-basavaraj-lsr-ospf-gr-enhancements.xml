    <abstract>

      procedures to improve routing convergence in some OSPF network
      deployments. This document updates RFC 3623 and RFC 5187.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>This document describes the enhancements to the current
      OSPF <xref target="RFC2328"/> and OSPFv3 <xref target="RFC5340"/>
      graceful restart procedures as respectively defined in
      OSPF Graceful Restart <xref target="RFC3623"/> and OSPFv3
      Graceful Restart <xref target="RFC5187"/> to improve routing convergence
      in certain OSPF network
      deployment scenarios. The goal is for both the restarting OSPF node and the
      helper OSPF node to terminate the OSPF graceful restart procedure faster and not
      wait for the grace period expiry in those network scenarios and hence improve the
      overall OSPF network convergence.</t>

          ]]></artwork>
      </figure></t>
      <t>As graphically depicted in figure 1, Router-2 is an area border router (ABR) with
      OSPF links in 2 areas. Furthermore, Router-2 has formed full adjacencies only in
      Area 0. In Area 1, Router-2 has an OSPF link enabled but Router2 could not form an
      adjacency either because Router-3 is down or Router-3 does not have OSPF enabled.
      Hence, Router-2 will only have a stub link in Area 1.</t>

      <t>On restart, the ABR router Router-2, having only a stub link in the Area 1, will
       never receive its pre-restart LSA in this area and will never form an adjacency and
       will have to wait for the grace period expiry leading to slower OSPF
       routing convergence.</t>

      <t>For this scenario, if no OSPF control packets are received within the dead interval
       on a link in Area 1 as per the above network scenario, Router-2 MUST mark the link
       as stub and MUST not wait for the grace period to form an adjacency on this
       link to successfully Exit GR.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Multiple Failure Scenarios">
       <t>In scenarios where more than one router is restarting at the same time in the same
          OSPF area and StrictLSAChecking is disabled, restarting OSPF routers will end up
          waiting the entire grace interval to exit GR. If the restarting routers receive a
          Grace Link State Advertisement (LSA) from another router in a given area after
          restart, and the helper routers receive grace LSAs from more than one router,
          this will indicate that there have been multiple failures. Therefore, the
          helper and restarting routers MUST terminate GR and avoid any unnecessary delay
          in OSPF routing convergence.</t>
